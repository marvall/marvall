## Hi, I'm Yaroslav 👋  
**Web Developer | JavaScript • React • Node.js**

I build modern web applications focused on real business needs, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability.

I work with both custom solutions and reusable templates, helping businesses turn ideas into structured, scalable digital products.

---

### 🧠 What I focus on
- Business-oriented web applications
- Clear system architecture and predictable development
- Clean, maintainable code without overengineering
- Step-by-step product growth instead of bloated MVPs

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### ⚙️ Core Stack (Primary)
Technologies I use most often in production projects:

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Vue.js / React**
- **Node.js**
- **Nginx**
- **Docker**
- **MySQL**

This stack covers the majority of modern web applications — from client-side interfaces to backend services and deployment.

---

### 🧩 Backend & Server-side
Used depending on project requirements and architecture:

- **Node.js** — main backend runtime
- **PHP** — integrations, automation scripts, legacy systems
- **Python** — background tasks, data processing, custom services

---

### 🗄 Databases
Experience working with both relational and non-relational databases:

- **SQL**: MySQL, PostgreSQL  
- **NoSQL**: document-oriented and key-value databases

For mid-size and scalable systems:
- **PostgreSQL + Hasura**
- **GraphQL APIs** for flexible and efficient data access

---

### 🔐 Infrastructure & DevOps
Comfortable working with server environments and security basics:

- **Linux server administration**
- **Nginx configuration**
- **Dockerized environments**
- **Firewall configuration and basic security hardening**

---

### 🧰 Tools & Workflow
- **Git & GitHub**
- **VS Code**
- **Terminal / CLI**

---

### 🧠 Approach
I choose technologies based on project complexity, scalability, and long-term maintainability — not trends.

---

### 🚀 Current work
- Developing personal and commercial web projects
- Building reusable templates for common business tasks
- Improving existing systems and refactoring legacy code

---

### 🤝 Collaboration
I’m open to:
- Long-term collaboration with teams and founders
